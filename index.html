	Hi!,<br/>
	Welcome to Nuggets-PHP. Nuggets-PHP is a PHP application framework that implements the MVC architecture.
	MVC stands for Model View Controller. Each module of an application built with Nuggets-PHP has these three components.
	The Model takes care of the data model of the application, which includes database operations, computational operations
	relating to the application and others that lead to the generation of data. The View manages the looks of the application
	or the way data is presented to the client. The Controller co-ordinates these two activities so that the server is able
	to present the appropriate information to the client in the appropriate way. 
</p>
<p>
	If you are a web developer, Nuggets-PHP will save a lot of time in building your applications. With Nuggets, you can get 
	and application up and running in a few minutes! Nuggets differs from the rest of the powerful frameworks available out
	there such as Zend and Cake-PHP, in that it is fairly simple to use. Nuggets was designed with ease of use in mind. Configuring
	Nuggets is a breeze as you only have to edit a few configuration files.
</p>
<p>
	Nuggets is open source. That means, anyone can use Nuggets and anyone can modify it's source code. However, originating
	as free software, Nuggets has to be kept free. Thus you cannot commercialize it. Nuggets is distributed under the GNU
	general public license. Please read the license agreement to know your limitations while using it.
